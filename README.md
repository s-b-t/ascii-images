### B33FWare ASCII Image2Art Converter

*Please Note: This program is in its BETA/WIP stage.*

First, go to your terminal and navigate to a folder where you can ```mkdir``` a name you think is suitable to save for this program.

When you're there, ```mkdir``` your folder name -- ```mkdir ascii-images``` is a suitable example.

Then, install Pillow right to the ```ascii-images``` (or whatever name you choose) project folder. To do this, type ```pip install pillow``` and press Enter.

```PIL``` aka ```pillow``` is used to assist the program in generating images to ASCII.

Once you're there, type and enter the following command:
  
  Windows: ```python main.py```
  
  MacOS: ```python3 main.py```

Once you've received the greeting message/header, enter whatever image path you want and watch the magic happen!
